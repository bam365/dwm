func stacknudgedown(Client C, Window W)
        Count requesters, non requesters
        Can C be nudged down?
                No => Set request size to set size, return
        Are there non-requesters ?
                Divvy up the new space between them
        Else find the smallest requester, give the space to it.


func stacknudgeup(Client C, Window W)
        Count requesters, non requesters
        Calculate available space
        Is it less than requested nudge up?
                Yes +> Set request size to set size, return
        Are there non-requesters ?
                Take the space from them equally
        Else find the largest requester, take space from it.



func sizestacked(Window W)
        Count requesters, non-requesters
        If there are requesters
                Make sure no window are requesting less than minimum
                Total up requested space
                Find maximum requestable space
                If we have requested more than maximum
                        Remove the requested space from each window
                         based on the ratio of that space it requested
                        Add any division error to the first requester
                Set stacksize of all requesters to requested size
        Find non-requested space
        Divvy it up between non-requesters.
        Add any division error to the first non-requester
